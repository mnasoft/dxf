Remarks

The properties that are associated with the Application object reflect the properties of the main application window. The methods control the loading or listing of the currently loaded external applications and interface objects.

The active document (AutoCAD drawing) can be accessed with the ActiveDocument property.

To access the Application object from VBA, use ThisDrawing.Application. To access the Application object from VB, use the Visual Basic 7 functions GetObject or CreateObject.

If AutoCAD is running, the GetObject function will retrieve the current AutoCAD Application object. When running multiple sessions of AutoCAD, the GetObject function will return the first instance of AutoCAD in the Windows Running Object Table. See the Microsoft Visual Basic 7 documentation for the Running Object Table (ROT) and the GetObject function (for more information about verifying the session returned by GetObject).

Use version-dependent ProgIDs. If a CreateObject or GetObject function uses a version-independent ProgID, change the function to use a version-dependent ProgID. For example, you would change CreateObject("AutoCAD.Application") to CreateObject("AutoCAD.Application.24").

The application object is also the Global object for the ActiveX interface. This means that all the methods and properties for the Application object are available in the global name space.

Use the Quit method to end the AutoCAD session.

Remarks

There are four types of blocks: the simple block, the XRef block, the layout block, and the dynamic block.

A simple block is a collection of objects that you can associate together to form a single object, or block definition. You can insert, scale, and rotate a simple block in a drawing. You can explode a simple block into its component objects, modify them, and redefine the block definition. Simple blocks can be defined from geometry in the current drawing, or by using another AutoCAD drawing. When you use another drawing to create a block, the new simple block is stored in the current drawing database; it is not updated if the original drawing changes. Inserting an instance of a simple block into the current drawing creates a BlockReference object.

An XRef block is an external link from another drawing to the current drawing. Because the XRef block represents a link to geometry, not the geometry itself, it is updated whenever the original drawing changes. Inserting an instance of an XRef block into the current drawing creates an ExternalReference object.

The layout blocks represent the geometry in the model space and paper space layouts. These blocks have a Layout object associated with them that contains the plot settings and other layout definition information. The block name of the active paper space layout is always *PAPER_SPACE. The other paper space layouts will have blocks named *PAPER_SPACEn, where n is an integer. Block names start with *PAPER_SPACE0, and the Integer increments by 1 each time a new layout is inserted.

By default, the layout blocks in a new drawing have the following names:

    *MODEL_SPACE - The model space layout. There is only one model space layout per drawing.

    This block corresponds to the ModelSpace collection.
    *PAPER_SPACE - The first paper space layout created. If the model space layout is currently active, this block contains the last active paper space layout.

    This block corresponds to the PaperSpace collection.
    *PAPER_SPACE0 - The second paper space layout created. If this layout is activated, its block is renamed *PAPER_SPACE and becomes accessible from the PaperSpace collection; the first layout's block is renamed *PAPER_SPACE0.

When you activate a new layout, it swaps block names with the layout that was formerly active. In this way, the block of the active layout is always named *PAPER_SPACE. For example, suppose Layout1 is active and Layout2 is associated with a block named *PAPER_SPACE0. If you then activate Layout2, it's block is renamed to *PAPER_SPACE, and Layout1's block is renamed to *PAPER_SPACE0.

Dynamic blocks enhance simple blocks by increasing their intelligence potential and adaptability. The internal geometry of a dynamic block instance can be adjusted independently of both its base definition and other instances. This flexibility is the central concept of dynamic blocks. Inserting an instance of a dynamic block into the current drawing creates a BlockReference object. From the block reference, you can get the DynamicBlockReferenceProperty object.

To identify a block's type, use the IsLayout , IsXRef , and IsDynamicBlock properties. If these properties are False, then the block is a simple block. If the IsXRef property is True, then the block is an external reference. If the IsLayout property is True, then the block contains all the geometry associated with a layout. If the IsDynamicBlock property is True, then the block is a dynamic block.

There is no limit to the number of objects a block can contain.

To insert a simple, XRef, or dynamic block into a drawing, use the InsertBlock method. To create a new layout block, use the Add method to add a new layout to the Layouts collection. When the new layout is created, an associated block for the layout will also be created.

Remarks

To create a block reference, first you must create a block definition, or block, by using the Add method. Once created, you can insert an instance of this block into your drawing using the InsertBlock method.

To add or delete items from the block reference, you must first use the Explode method to break it into its component objects. Even though a block reference is broken into its component objects, the block definition still remains in the drawings block symbol table.

Remarks

To add a new member to the collection, use the Add method. To select a specific block, use the Item method.

There are two special blocks in the collection. One contains the collection of all model space entities, the ModelSpace collection; the other contains all paper space entities, the PaperSpace collection.

Although the Blocks collection inherits a Delete method, you cannot actually delete the collection. Attempting to delete the Blocks collection will result in an error, therefore the Delete method has been removed from the documentation for this collection.

There is no limit to the number of blocks you can create in your drawing. However, there can be only one instance of the Blocks collection. The Blocks collection is predefined for each drawing. You can make multiple references to it by using the Blocks property. Once done with an object, the reference is automatically released.

Remarks

The ComparedReference object inherits its members from the ExternalReference object. You can use ActiveX to query and edit ComparedReference entities in an AutoCAD drawing. However, you cannot create a ComparedReference object with ActiveX.

There is no member property that allows you to identify an ExternalReference object as being of the ComparedReference type; however, you can cast-type an AcadEntity or AcadExternalReference to the AcadComparedReference object type and use error handling to determine if the cast was successful.

The following code samples show how you can use cast-typing to determine if an entity is of type ComparedReference.

VBA:

' Checks to see if an object is of the ComparedReference type
Sub CheckForComparedReference()
  Dim ent As AcadEntity
  Dim comRef As AcadComparedReference
  
  On Error Resume Next

  ' Step through all the objects in model space
  For Each ent In ThisDrawing.ModelSpace
  
    ' Check to see if the object is a Block Reference
    If ent.ObjectName = "AcDbBlockReference" Then
    
      ' Try to cast the entity (Block Reference) to a ComparedReference
      Set comRef = ent
    
      ' If an occurs, then the entity is not a ComparedReference
      If Err <> 0 Then
        MsgBox "Not a Compared Reference"
      Else
        MsgBox "Xref Name: " + comRef.Name + vbLf + "Compared Reference"
      End If
    
      ' Clear the Error object
      Err.Clear
    End If
  Next ent
End Sub

Visual LISP:

(vl-load-com)
(defun c:CheckForComparedReference()
  ;; Checks to see if an object is of the ComparedReference type
  (setq acadObj (vlax-get-acad-object))
  (setq doc (vla-get-ActiveDocument acadObj))

  ;; Step through all the objects in model space
  (vlax-for obj (vla-get-ModelSpace doc)
    ;; Check to see if the object is a Block Reference
    (if (= (vla-get-objectname obj) "AcDbBlockReference")
      (progn
        ;; Transform the VLA-OBJECT to an ENAME
        (setq entName (vlax-vla-object->ename obj))

        ;; Check to see what the value of the IsComparedReference property is of the entity
        (if (vl-catch-all-error-p (vl-catch-all-apply 'getpropertyvalue (list entName "IsComparedReference")))
          ;; If an error occurs, then the entity is not a ComparedReference
          (alert "Not a Compared Reference")
          (alert (strcat "Xref Name: "
                         (vla-get-name obj)

To add a new member to the collection, use the Add method. To select a specific dictionary, use the Item method.

Although the Dictionaries collection inherits a Delete method, you cannot actually delete the collection. Attempting to delete the Dictionaries collection will result in an error. The Delete method has been removed from the documentation for this collection.

There is no limit to the number of dictionaries that you can create in your drawing. However, there can be only one instance of the Dictionaries collection. The Dictionaries collection is predefined for each drawing. You can make multiple references to it by using the Dictionaries property. Once done with an object, the reference is automatically released.

Remarks

Dictionaries provide a mechanism for storing and retrieving objects with associated string keywords.

The objects in a dictionary may be referenced by their keywords. A dictionary can contain any type of object, including other dictionaries. A dictionary does not perform type checking of entries.

You can create new dictionaries, add entries to an existing dictionary, and get the keyword for a given object or the object for a given keyword. You can change the object that is associated with a given keyword, or rename the keyword for a given object.

This dictionary is similar to a collection in AutoCAD, and is used for custom object implementation. This object does not represent the spell checking dictionary. The spell checking dictionary is specified in the Preferences object.

To add a dictionary to the application, use the Add method.

Remarks

When creating a three point angular dimension, AutoCAD draws the dimension line arc between the extension lines. The extension lines are drawn from the angle endpoints to the intersection of the dimension line arc.


A 3 point angular dimension

AutoCAD uses the location of the dimension line arc to choose between the minor and major angles specified by the angle vertex and extension lines.

To create a three point angular dimension, use the AddDim3PointAngular method.

** Add Method (ActiveX)

Creates a member object and adds it to the appropriate collection.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature - Blocks

VBA:

RetVal = object.Add(InsertionPoint, Name)

object

    Type: Blocks

    The object this method applies to.
InsertionPoint

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (three-element array of doubles)

    The 3D WCS coordinates specifying where the Blocks object will be added.
Name

    Access: Input-only

    Type: String

    The name of the block to add to the collection.

Signature - UCSs

VBA:

RetVal = object.Add(Origin, XAxisPoint, YAxisPoint, Name)

object

    Type: UCSs

    The object this method applies to.
Origin

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (three-element array of doubles)

    The 3D WCS coordinates specifying where the UCS is to be added.
XAxisPoint

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (three-element array of doubles)

    The 3D WCS coordinates specifying a point on the positive X axis of the UCS. The XAxisPoint and YAxisPoint together cannot specify the same location as the Origin.
YAxisPoint

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (three-element array of doubles)

    The 3D WCS coordinates specifying a point on the positive Y axis of the UCS. (The Z axis follows by applying the right-hand rule.)
Name

    Access: Input-only

    Type: String

    The name of the UCS to add to the collection.

Signature - Hyperlinks

VBA:

RetVal = object.Add(Name [, Description] [, NamedLocation])

object

    Type: Hyperlinks

    The object this method applies to.
Name

    Access: Input-only

    Type: String

    The name of the hyperlink to add.
Description

    Access: Input-only; optional

    Type: Variant

object

    Type: PlotConfigurations

    The object this method applies to.
Name

    Access: Input-only

    Type: String

    The name of the object to add to the collection.

    The object this method applies to.
Name

    Access: Input-only; optional the Documents object

    Type: String

    The name of the object to add to the collection. For the Documents, this name represents the name of the drawing template to use and will accept a URL address or a fully qualified path and file name.

Return Value (RetVal)

Type: Block, Dictionary, DimStyle, Document, Group, Hyperlink, Layer, Layout, Linetype, Material, PlotConfiguration, PopupMenu, RegisteredApplication, SelectionSet, TextStyle, Toolbar, UCS, View, Viewport

The newly added object.
Remarks

Although you can create a linetype and add it to the Linetypes object using this method, it will be created with the default properties only. Because you cannot edit properties of the Linetype object with this release of ActiveX Automation, use the Load method to load existing linetypes into your drawing.

Layers are created with default color and linetype properties. The default color is white, and the default linetype is standard.

Documents: When accessing a secure URL, a dialog box will be posted that prompts the user for the necessary password information. Message boxes may also be displayed if the user has not suppressed this activity in the browser. When downloading a file, AutoCAD creates a temporary file for internal processing. Do not attempt to access this temporary file. Information in this file is deleted at the end of the AutoCAD session.

Group: You should not specify a Name that is excessively long or contains spaces, because these names are not handled well in the Group dialog box and cannot be entered at the command line.

** Add3DFace Method (ActiveX)

Creates a 3DFace object given four vertices.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

RetVal = object.Add3DFace(Point1, Point2, Point3 [, Point4])

object

    Type: Block, ModelSpace, PaperSpace

    The objects this method applies to.
Point1

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (three-element array of doubles)

    The 3D WCS coordinates specifying a point on the 3DFace object.
Point2

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (three-element array of doubles)

    The 3D WCS coordinates specifying a point on the 3DFace object.
Point3

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (three-element array of doubles)

    The 3D WCS coordinates specifying a point on the 3DFace object.
Point4

    Access: Input-only; optional

    Type: Variant (three-element array of doubles)

    The 3D WCS coordinates specifying a point on the 3DFace object. If omitted, this point will default to the coordinates of Point3 in order to create a three-sided face.

Return Value (RetVal)

Type: 3DFace

The newly created 3DFace object.
Remarks

To create a three-sided face, omit the last point. Use the SetInvisibleEdge method to set the visibility of an edge.

Points must be entered sequentially in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction to create a 3DFace object. You can create multiple adjacent faces by specifying the first two points of an additional face exactly as the last two points of the previous face.


Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_Add3DFace()
    ' This example creates a 3D face in model space.

    Dim faceObj As Acad3DFace
    Dim point1(0 To 2) As Double

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Double

    The text height in the current drawing unit.
Mode

    Access: Input-only

    Type: AcAttributeMode enum

    Any combination of constants can be used by adding them together:

        acAttributeModeInvisible: Specifies that attribute values will not appear when you insert the block. The AutoCAD ATTDISP command overrides the Invisible mode.
        acAttributeModeConstant: Gives attributes a fixed value for block insertions.
        acAttributeModeVerify: Prompts to verify the attribute value is correct when the block is inserted.
        acAttributeModeLockPosition: Locks the position of the attributes.
        acAttributeModeMultipleLine: Allows the attributes to carry-over onto multiple lines. Prompts you to verify that the attribute value is correct when you insert the block.
        acAttributeModePreset: Sets the attribute to its default value when you insert a block containing a current attribute. The value cannot be edited in this mode.

Prompt

    Access: Input-only

    Type: String

    This string appears when a block containing this attribute is inserted. The default for this string is the Tag string. Inputting acAttributeModeConstant for the Mode parameter disables the prompt.
InsertionPoint

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (three-element array of doubles)

    The 3D WCS coordinates specifying the location for the attribute.
Tag

    Access: Input-only

    Type: String

    This non-null string identifies each occurrence of the attribute. Enter any characters except spaces or exclamation points. AutoCAD changes lowercase letters to uppercase.
Value

    Access: Input-only

    Type: String

    This non-null string is the default attribute value.

Return Value (RetVal)

Type: Attribute

The newly created Attribute object.
Remarks

An attribute definition is associated to the block for which it is created. Attribute definitions created in model space or paper space are not considered to be attached to any given block.

The AutoCAD AFLAGS system variable stores the mode setting. You can query this value using the GetVariable method, or set it using the SetVariable method.

** AddDimDiametric Method (ActiveX)

Creates a diametric dimension for a circle or arc given the two points on the diameter and the length of the leader line.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

RetVal = object.AddDimDiametric(ChordPoint, FarChordPoint, LeaderLength)

object

    Type: Block, ModelSpace, PaperSpace

    The objects this method applies to.
ChordPoint

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (three-element array of doubles)

    The 3D WCS coordinates specifying the first diameter point on the circle or arc.
FarChordPoint

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (three-element array of doubles)

    The 3D WCS coordinates specifying the second diameter point on the circle or arc.
LeaderLength

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Double

    The positive value representing the length from the ChordPoint to the annotation text or dogleg.

Return Value (RetVal)

Type: DimDiametric

The newly created diameter dimension object.
Remarks

Different types of diameter dimensions are created depending on the size of the circle or arc, the length of the leader line, and the values of the AutoCAD DIMUPT, DIMTOFL, DIMFIT, DIMTIH, DIMTOH, DIMJUST, and DIMTAD system variables.

For horizontal dimension text, if the angle of the dimension line is more than 15 degrees from horizontal, and is outside the circle or arc, AutoCAD draws a hook line, also called a landing or dogleg. The hook line is one arrowhead long, and is placed next to the dimension text, as shown in the first two illustrations.


This function uses the LeaderLength parameter as the distance from the ChordPoint to the point where the dimension will do a horizontal dogleg to the annotation text (or stop if no dogleg is necessary).

The LeaderLength setting will only be used during the creation of the dimension (and even then only if the dimension is set to use the default text position value). After the dimension has been closed for the first time, changing the LeaderLength value will not affect how the dimension displays, but the new setting will be stored and will show up in DXF, LISP, and ARX.
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_AddDimDiametric()
    ' This example creates a diametric dimension in model space.
    
    Dim dimObj As AcadDimDiametric
    Dim chordPoint(0 To 2) As Double

Different types of radial dimensions are created depending on the size of the circle or arc, the TextPosition property and the values in the AutoCAD DIMUPT, DIMTOFL, DIMFIT, DIMTIH, DIMTOH, DIMJUST, and DIMTAD dimension system variables. (System variables can be queried or set using the GetVariable and SetVariable methods.)

For horizontal dimension text, if the angle of the dimension line is more than 15 degrees from horizontal, and is outside the circle or arc, AutoCAD draws a hook line, also called a landing or dogleg. The hook line is one arrowhead long, and is placed next to the dimension text, as shown in the first two illustrations.


This method uses length as the distance from the ChordPoint out to where the dimension will do a horizontal dogleg to the annotation text (or stop if no dogleg is necessary).

The LeaderLength setting will only be used during the creation of the dimension (and even then only if the dimension is set to use the default text position value). After the dimension has been closed for the first time, changing the LeaderLength value will not affect how the dimension displays, but the new setting will be stored and will show up in DXF, LISP, and ARX.

    The taper angle of the extrusion must be provided in radians. The range of the taper angle is from -90 to +90 degrees.

    Positive angles taper in from the base, negative angles taper out. The default angle, 0, extrudes a 2D object perpendicular to its plane.

Return Value (RetVal)

Type: 3DSolid

A 3DSolid object as the newly created extruded solid.
Remarks

You can extrude only 2D planar regions.

Tapered extrusions are possible only with loops that are continuous at the vertices. A large taper angle or long extrusion height can cause the object, or portions of the object, to intersect with itself before reaching the extrusion height. AutoCAD does not allow an extrusion when the resulting solid intersects with itself.

** AddHatch Method (ActiveX)

Creates a Hatch object.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

RetVal = object.AddHatch(PatternType, PatternName, Associativity [, HatchObjectType])

object

    Type: Block, ModelSpace, PaperSpace

    The objects this method applies to.
PatternType

    Access: Input-only

    Type: AcPatternType or AcGradientPatternType enum

    If the HatchObjectType parameter value is acHatchObject, then use the AcPatternType enum; if the HatchObjectType parameter value is AcGradientObject, then use the AcGradientPatternType enum.

        AcPatternType enum
        acHatchPatternTypePredefined: Selects the pattern name from those defined in the acad.pat file.
        acHatchPatternTypeUserDefined: Defines a pattern of lines using the current linetype.
        acHatchPatternTypeCustomDefined: Selects the pattern name from a PAT file other than the acad.pat file.

        AcGradientPatternType enum
        acPreDefinedGradient: Selects the fill name from one of the standard values.
        acUserDefinedGradient: Defines a pattern based on property values.

PatternName

    Access: Input-only

    Type: String

    If the HatchObjectType parameter value is acHatchObject, then PatternName should contain the hatch pattern name. If the HatchObjectType parameter value is acGradientObject, then PatternName should contain one of the gradient pattern names listed in GradientName.
Associativity

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Boolean

        True: The hatch will be associative.
        False: The hatch will not be associative.

HatchObjectType

    Access: Input-only

    Type: AcHatchObjectType enum

    The default value is the AcHatchObjectType enum value of AcHatchObject. If the AcHatchObjectType enum value is AcGradientObject, then PatternType should be of type AcGradientPatternType, and PatternName should contain the gradient pattern name.

Return Value (RetVal)

Type: Hatch

The newly created Hatch object.
Remarks

After the Hatch object is created, you must add the outer loop using the AppendOuterLoop method. The outer loop must be closed and must be created before any inner loops can be created. Inner loops are created one at a time, using the AppendInnerLoop method.
Note: Once the Hatch object has been created, you must append the outer loop to the Hatch object for it to become a valid AutoCAD object. If you attempt any operation other than calling the AppendOuterLoop method, AutoCAD will enter an unpredictable state.

** AddLeader Method (ActiveX)

Creates a leader line based on the provided coordinates or adds a new leader cluster to the MLeader object.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature - Block, ModelSpace, PaperSpace

VBA:

RetVal = object.AddLeader(PointsArray, Annotation, Type)

object

    Type: Block, ModelSpace, PaperSpace

    The objects this method applies to.
PointsArray

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (array of doubles)

    The array of 3D WCS coordinates specifying the leader. You must provide at least two points to define the leader. The third point is optional.
Annotation

    Access: Input-only

    Type: BlockReference, MText, Tolerance

    The object that should be attached to the leader. The value can also be NULL to not attach an object.
Type

    Access: Input-only

    Type: AcLeaderType enum

        acLineNoArrow
        acLineWithArrow
        acSplineNoArrow
        acSplineWithArrow

Signature - MLeader

VBA:

RetVal = object.AddLeader

object

    Type: MLeader

    The object this method applies to.

Return Value (RetVal) - Block, ModelSpace, PaperSpace

Type: Leader

The newly created Leader object.
Return Value (RetVal) - MLeader

Type: Long

The index of the added leader cluster
Remarks

Block, ModelSpace, PaperSpace: The leader is a line that connects some annotation to a feature in a drawing. Leaders and their annotation are associative, which means if you modify the annotation, the leader updates accordingly. The annotation can be a Tolerance, MText, or BlockReference object.

You can also create leaders that are not associated to a particular object. To do this, simply input a NULL object as the annotation.

Remarks

The vertices specify the endpoints for the line segments that make up the polyline. To add an arc segment, first create the polyline with all line segments, and then add a bulge to the individual segments you want to be arcs. To add a bulge value to a segment, use the SetBulge method.

The elevation for the polyline will be set at the current elevation for the layout. Use the ElevationModelspace or ElevationPaperspace property to determine the elevation for the polyline.

Coordinates can be converted to and from the OCS using the TranslateCoordinates method.

** AddPolyfaceMesh Method (ActiveX)

Creates a polyface mesh from a list of vertices.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

RetVal = object.AddPolyfaceMesh(VerticesList, FaceList)

object

    Type: Block, ModelSpace, PaperSpace

    The objects this method applies to.
VerticesList

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (array of doubles)

    An array of 3D WCS coordinates used to create the polyface mesh vertices. At least four points (twelve elements) are required for constructing a polyface mesh object. The array size must be a multiple of three.
FaceList

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (array of integers)

    An array of integers representing the vertex numbers for each face. Faces are defined in groups of four vertex index values, so the size of this array must be a multiple of four.

Return Value (RetVal)

Type: PolyfaceMesh

The newly created PolyfaceMesh object.
Remarks

Creating a polyface mesh is similar to creating a rectangular mesh. To create a polyface mesh, you specify the coordinates for its vertices and the vertex numbers for all the vertices of that face.

In the following illustration, face 1 is defined by vertices 1, 5, 6, and 2. Face 2 is defined by vertices 1, 4, 3, and 2. Face 3 is defined by vertices 1, 4, 7, and 5, and face 4 is defined by vertices 3, 4, 7, and 8.


To make an edge invisible, enter the vertex number for the edge as a negative value. For instance, to make the edge between vertices 5 and 7 invisible in the following illustration, you would set the following:

Face 3, vertex 3: -7
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_AddPolyfaceMesh()
    
    Dim vertexList(0 To 17) As Double

    'Data

** AddPolyline Method (ActiveX)

Creates a polyline from a list of vertices.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

RetVal = object.AddPolyline(VerticesList)

object

    Type: Block, ModelSpace, PaperSpace

    The objects this method applies to.
VerticesList

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (array of doubles)

    An array of OCS coordinates used to create the polyline vertices. Each vertex is represented with three elements, with the first two being the X and Y coordinates in OCS; the third element is ignored. At least two points (six elements) are required for constructing a polyline object. The array size must be a multiple of three.

Return Value (RetVal)

Type: Polyline

The newly created Polyline object.
Remarks

To create a polyline containing arcs, first create the straight polyline, and then set the bulge at specific vertices using the SetBulge method.

This method exists for backward compatibility only. Use the AddLightweightPolyline method to create polylines with an optimized format that saves memory and disk space.

Coordinates can be converted to and from the OCS using the TranslateCoordinates method.

    Type: Block, ModelSpace, PaperSpace

    The objects this method applies to.
ImageFileName

    Access: Input-only

    Type: String

    The full path and file name of the image.
InsertionPoint

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (three-element array of doubles)

    The 3D WCS coordinates in the drawing where the raster image will be created.
ScaleFactor

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Double

    The raster image scale factor. The default image scale factor is 1. The scale factor must be a positive number. You can set the scale of the image to the scale of the geometry created in the AutoCAD drawing.

    The rotation angle in radians for the raster image.

Return Value (RetVal)

Type: RasterImage

The newly created RasterImage object.
Remarks

Images placed through the AddRaster method are not actually part of the drawing file. The raster image is linked to the drawing file through a path name or document ID. Linked image paths can be changed or removed at any time by using the SupportPath property. By attaching images using linked image paths, you place images in your drawing without increasing the file size of the drawing.

You can add the same raster image file to your drawing file multiple times. Each instance has its own clip boundary and its own settings for brightness, contrast, fade, and transparency. A single image can be cut into multiple pieces that can be rearranged independently in your drawing.

(defun c:Example_AddRay()
    ;; This example creates a ray in model space.
    (setq acadObj (vlax-get-acad-object))
    (setq doc (vla-get-ActiveDocument acadObj))

** AddRegion Method (ActiveX)

Creates a region from a set of entities. The given entities must form a closed coplanar region.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

RetVal = object.AddRegion(ObjectList)

object

    Type: Block, ModelSpace, PaperSpace

    The objects this method applies to.
ObjectList

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (array of Arc, Circle, Ellipse, Line, LWPolyline, Spline objects)

    The array of objects forming the closed coplanar face to be made into a region.

Return Value (RetVal)

Type: Variant (array of Region objects)

This method outputs an array of the newly created Region objects.
Remarks

This method will create a region out of every closed loop formed by the input array of curves. AutoCAD converts closed 2D and planar 3D polylines to separate regions, and then converts polylines, lines, and curves that form closed planar loops. If more than two curves share an endpoint, the resultant region might be arbitrary.

You can explode a region into the individual loops by using the Explode method. The Boolean method allows you to create composite 3D solids or regions from the intersection, union, or subtraction of a solid or region from another solid or region.

The total number of Region objects created is Ubound(objRegions) - Lbound(objRegions) + 1.
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_AddRegion()
    ' This example creates a region from an arc and a line.
    
    Dim curves(0 To 1) As AcadEntity

    ' Define the arc
    Dim centerPoint(0 To 2) As Double

Signature

VBA:

RetVal = object.AddSubMenu(Index, Label)

object

    Type: PopupMenu

    The object this method applies to.
Index

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant

    The index location in the menu where the item is to be added.

    If an integer is used to specify a given location in the menu, the index must be between 0 and N-1, where N is the number of objects in the popup menu. The new item will be added immediately before the specified index location. To add the new menu item to the end of a menu, set the index to be greater than N.

    If a string is specified and the indexed item does not exist, then the new menu item is added at the end of the menu.
Label

    Access: Input-only

    Type: String

    The label for the menu item. The label may contain DIESEL string expressions. Labels also identify the accelerator keys (keyboard key sequences) that correspond to the menu item by placing an ampersand (&) in front of the accelerator character.

Return Value (RetVal)

Type: PopupMenu

The newly created submenu. This new cascading menu is blank, and can be populated with standard menu handling techniques.
Remarks

This method creates a new PopupMenuItem object and adds it to the designated menu. This special kind of PopupMenuItem object is assigned the type of acSubmenu.

In the following example menu, the Align Text menu item has been inserted into the Dimension menu at the 17th index. The Align Text menu item is of the type acSubmenu. All other menu entries in the example are of the type acMenuItem or acMenuSeparator. The small cascading menu that is displayed when Align Text is selected is the new menu that was returned by the AddSubmenu method. It has been populated using the AddMenuItem and AddSeparator methods.

The endpoints of a trace are always on the centerline and are always cut square. AutoCAD automatically calculates the correct bevels for connection to adjacent trace segments.

Traces are solid filled when the Fill mode is on. When Fill mode is off, only the outline of a trace appears.

To set the Fill mode, use the AutoCAD FILLMODE system variable. The AutoCAD TRACEWID system variable stores the current width used for Trace objects.
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_AddTrace()
    ' This example creates a trace in model space.

** AppendInnerLoop Method (ActiveX)

Appends an inner loop to the hatch.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.AppendInnerLoop Loop

object

    Type: Hatch

    The object this method applies to.
Loop

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (array of Arc, Circle, Ellipse, Line, Polyline, Region, Spline objects)

    An array of objects forming a closed boundary. The array can consist of one or more objects. If more than one object is used, their endpoints must coincide for the loop to be created properly.

Return Value (RetVal)

No return value.
Remarks

After the Hatch object has been created using the AddHatch method, add the outer loop using AppendOuterLoop. The outer loop must be closed and must be created before any inner loops can be added.

** AppendOuterLoop Method (ActiveX)

Appends an outer loop to the hatch.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.AppendOuterLoop loop

object

    Type: Hatch

    The object this method applies to.
Loop

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (array of Arc, Circle, Ellipse, Line, Polyline, Region, Spline objects)

    An array of objects forming a closed boundary. The array can consist of one or more objects. If more than one object is used, their endpoints must coincide for the loop to be created properly.

Return Value (RetVal)

No return value.
Remarks

After the Hatch object has been created using the AddHatch method, add the outer loop. The outer loop must be closed and must be created before any inner loops can be added. After a valid outer loop has been created, add any inner loops, one at a time, using the AppendInnerLoop method.

Once you have finished defining the boundaries for the hatch, use the Evaluate method to calculate the hatch lines or fill for the boundaries, then use the Regen method to update the display of the hatch.

** AppendVertex Method (ActiveX)

Appends a vertex to the end of a 3DPolyline, Polyline, or PolygonMesh object.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.AppendVertex Point

object

    Type: 3DPolyline, PolygonMesh, Polyline

    The objects this method applies to.
Point

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (three-element array of doubles)

    The coordinates specifying the vertex to be appended.

    PolygonMesh: An array of 3D WCS coordinates specifying the appended row of vertices.

    3DPolyline: An array of 3D WCS coordinates specifying the vertex to append.

    Polyline: An array of 3D coordinates. The X and Y coordinates are given in OCS, the Z coordinate is ignored.

Return Value (RetVal)

No return value.
Remarks

PolygonMesh: When you append a vertex to the end of a PolygonMesh object, you are appending a row of vertices. For example, for a 4 x 3 PolygonMesh you define 12 vertices. Appending a vertex would make the matrix 5 x 3, thereby requiring three additional coordinates. If the 4 x 3 matrix had the following as its last vertex:

    vertex(3,0): 6,6,6
    vertex(3,1): 7,7,7
    vertex(3,2): 8,8,8

You would append:

    vertex(4,0): 10,10,10
    vertex(4,1): 10,5,0
    vertex(4,2): 10,20,30

The OCS coordinates for the Polyline object can be converted to and from other coordinate systems using the TranslateCoordinates method.
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_AppendVertex()
    ' This example creates a polyline in model space.
    ' It then appends a vertex to the polyline.
    
    Dim plineObj As AcadPolyline

** ArrayPolar Method (ActiveX)

Creates a polar array of objects given a NumberOfObjects, AngleToFill, and CenterPoint.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

RetVal = object.ArrayPolar(NumberOfObjects, AngleToFill, CenterPoint)

object

    Type: All drawing objects

    The objects this method applies to.
NumberOfObjects

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Long

    The number of objects to be created in the polar array. This must be a positive integer greater than 1.
AngleToFill

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Double

    The angle to fill in radians. A positive value specifies counterclockwise rotation. A negative value specifies clockwise rotation. An error is returned for an angle that equals 0.
CenterPoint

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (three-element array of doubles)

    The 3D WCS coordinates specifying the center point for the polar array.

Return Value (RetVal)

Type: Variant (array of objects)

The array of new objects.
Remarks

AutoCAD determines the distance from the array's center point to a reference point on the last object selected. The reference point used depends on the type of object previously selected. AutoCAD uses the center point of a circle or arc, the insertion point of a block or shape, the start point of text, and one endpoint of a line or trace.

Note that this method does not support the Rotate While Copying option of the AutoCAD ARRAY command.


Polar array with NumberOfObjects = 5, AngleToFill = 180, CenterPoint = 0,0,0.
Note: You cannot execute this method while simultaneously iterating through a collection. An iteration will open the work space for a read-only operation, while this method attempts to perform a read-write operation. Complete any iteration before you call this method.

AttributeReference: You should not attempt to use this method on AttributeReference objects. AttributeReference objects inherit this method because they are one of the drawing objects, however, it is not feasible to perform this operation on an attribute reference.

    The number of columns in the rectangular array. This must be a positive number. If this number is 1, then NumberOfRows must be greater than 1.
NumberOfLevels

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Long

    The number of levels in a 3D array.
DistBetweenRows

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Double

    The distance between the rows. If the distance between rows is a positive number, rows are added upward from the base entity. If the distance is a negative number, rows are added downward.
DistBetweenColumns

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Double

    The distance between the columns. If the distance between columns is a positive number, columns are added to the right of the base entity. If the distance is a negative number, columns are added to the left.
DistBetweenLevels

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Double

    The distance between the array levels. If the distance between levels is a positive number, levels are added in the positive direction from the base entity. If the distance is a negative number, levels are added in the negative direction.

Return Value (RetVal)

Type: Variant (array of objects)

The array of newly created objects.
Remarks

For a 2D array, specify the NumberOfRows, NumberOfColumns, DistBetweenRow, and DistBetweenColumns. For creating a 3D array, specify the NumberOfLevels and DistBetweenLevels as well.

A rectangular array is constructed by replicating the object in the selection set the appropriate number of times. If you define one row, you must specify more than one column and vice versa.

The object in the selection set is assumed to be in the lower left-hand corner, and the array is generated up and to the right. If the distance between rows is a negative number, rows are added downward. If the distance between columns is a negative number, the columns are added to the left.

AutoCAD builds the rectangular array along a baseline defined by the current snap rotation angle. This angle is zero by default, so the rows and columns of a rectangular array are orthogonal with respect to the X and Y drawing axes. You can change this angle and create a rotated array by setting the snap rotation angle to a nonzero value. To do this, use the SnapRotationAngle property.


Rectangular array with NumberOfRows = 4, NumberOfColumns = 3, DistBetweenRows = a, DistBetweenColumns = b. The base entity is represented in blue.
Note: You cannot execute this method while simultaneously iterating through a collection. An iteration will open the work space for a read-only operation, while this method attempts to perform a read-write operation. Complete any iteration before you call this method.

AttributeReference: You should not attempt to use this method on AttributeReference objects. AttributeReference objects inherit this method because they are one of the drawing objects, however, it is not feasible to perform this operation on an attribute reference.

** AttachToolbarToFlyout Method (ActiveX)

Attaches a toolbar to a toolbar button defined as a flyout.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.AttachToolbarToFlyout MenuGroupName, ToolbarName

object

    Type: ToolbarItem

    The object this method applies to.
MenuGroupName

    Access: Input-only

    Type: String

    The name of the menu group containing the toolbar you want to attach.
ToolbarName

    Access: Input-only

    Type: String

    The name of the toolbar you want to attach.

Return Value (RetVal)

No return value.
Remarks

To create a new button as a flyout, use the AddToolBarButton method and set the FlyoutButton parameter to True. Once a button has been created as a flyout button, you can then use the AttachToolbarToFlyout method to attach a flyout toolbar to that button.

To query a toolbar button to see if it is a flyout button, use the Type property. To find the toolbar attached to a flyout toolbar button, use the Flyout property.
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_AttachToolbarToFlyout()
    ' This example uses MenuGroups to obtain a reference to the AutoCAD main menu.
    ' It then creates a new Toolbar(TestMenu) with a Toolbar button that will act
    ' as a flyout.  It then sets the Flyout menu to an existing Toolbar menu.

object

    Type: Document

    The object this method applies to.
FixError

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Boolean

        True: AutoCAD should attempt to fix any problems it encounters.
        False: AutoCAD should not attempt to fix any problems it encounters.

Return Value (RetVal)

No return value.
Remarks

For every error detected, AutoCAD provides a description of the error and recommends corrective action.

If you specify FixError = True, AutoCAD will attempt to fix any errors it encounters.
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_AuditInfo()
    ' This example has AutoCAD audit
    ' and fix any problems found
    
    ThisDrawing.AuditInfo True

* Methods B
** Bind Method (ActiveX)

Binds an external reference (xref) to a drawing.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.Bind bPrefixName

object

    Type: Block

    The object this method applies to.
bPrefixName

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Boolean

        True: Symbol names are not prefixed.
        False: Symbol names are prefixed with <blockname>$x$.

Return Value (RetVal)

No return value.
Remarks

Binding an xref to a drawing makes the xref a permanent part of the drawing and no longer an externally referenced file. The externally referenced information becomes a block. When the externally referenced drawing is updated, the bound xref is not updated. This method binds the entire drawing's database, including all of its dependent symbols. Dependent symbols are named objects such as blocks, dimension styles, layers, linetypes, and text styles. Binding the xref allows named objects from the xref to be used in the current drawing.

If the bPrefixName parameter is set to False, the symbol names of the xref drawing are prefixed in the current drawing with <blockname>$x$, where x is an integer that is automatically incremented to avoid overriding existing block definitions. If the bPrefixName parameter is set to True, the symbol names of the xref drawing are merged into the current drawing without the prefix. If duplicate names exist, AutoCAD uses the symbols already defined in the local drawing. If you are unsure whether your drawing contains duplicate symbol names, it is recommended that you set bPrefixName to False.
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_Bind()

    Type: 3DSolid, Region

    The objects this method applies to.
Operation

    Access: Input-only

    Type: AcBooleanType enum

        acUnion: Performs a union operation.
        acIntersection: Performs an intersection operation.
        acSubtraction: Performs a subtraction operation.

Object

    Access: input-only

    Type: 3DSolid, Region

    The object the operation is performed against.

Return Value (RetVal)

No return value.
Remarks

The first object is modified as a result of the operation.

** Close Method (ActiveX)

Closes the specified drawing, or all open drawings.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.Close [SaveChanges] [, FileName]

object

    Type: Document, Documents

    The objects this method applies to.
SaveChanges

    Access: Input-only; optional

    Type: Variant

    Specifies if the drawing is to be saved or not. (Not applicable when called from Documents collection.)

        True: Save the drawing.
        False: Do not save the drawing.

FileName

    Access: Input-only; optional

    Type: String

    The name to assign to the drawing. If no name is provided when saving a drawing for the first time, the drawing will be saved using the VBA project information: ThisDrawing.Path\ThisDrawing.Name. (Not applicable when called from Documents collection.)

Return Value (RetVal)

No return value.
Remarks

If there are no changes to the drawing, SaveChanges and FileName are ignored. If there are changes to the drawing, SaveChanges specifies whether changes should be saved. The default value for the SaveChanges parameter is True.

    If SaveChanges is True and there is not yet a file name associated with a drawing, then the FileName argument is used. If FileName is omitted, or if calling this method from the Documents collection, an error will be issued.
    If SaveChanges is False, then the drawing is closed and the changes are not saved.

Calling this method from the Documents collection in MDI mode will close all open drawings. To close a single drawing, call this method from the drawing to be closed.

You cannot close a drawing from inside an event handler for that drawing.
Note: Closing a drawing destroys the Document object. Never try to reference an object once it has been destroyed, or in this case, closed. In-process clients (VBA macros) may notice that objects are not destroyed until the subroutine is exited. However, references to destroyed objects are not recommended at all, even in the in-process code.
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_Close()
    ' This example cycles through the documents collection
    ' and closes all open drawings using the Close method.

    Dim DOC As AcadDocument
    
    ' If there are no open documents, then exit
    If Documents.count = 0 Then
        MsgBox "There are no open documents!"
        Exit Sub
    End If
    
    ' Close all open documents
    For Each DOC In Documents
        If MsgBox("Do you wish to close the document: " & DOC.WindowTitle, vbYesNo & vbQuestion) = vbYes Then
            If DOC.FullName <> "" Then
                DOC.Close
            Else
                MsgBox DOC.name & " has not been saved yet, so it will not be closed."
            End If
        End If
    Next

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.ConvertToAnonymousBlock

object

    Type: BlockReference, ComparedReference, ExternalReference, MInsertBlock

    The objects this method applies to.

Return Value (RetVal)

No return value.
Remarks

The ComparedReference and ExternalReference objects inherit this method from BlockReference, but this method doesn't affect either of the object types when used.
Examples

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.ConvertToStaticBlock newBlockName

object

    Type: BlockReference, ComparedReference, ExternalReference, MInsertBlock

    The objects this method applies to.
newBlockName

    Access: Input-only

    Type: String

    The name for the block.

Return Value (RetVal)

** Copy Method (ActiveX)

Duplicates the given object to the same location.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

RetVal = object.Copy

object

    Type: All drawing objects, AttributeReference, Dimension

    The objects this method applies to.

Return Value (RetVal)

Type: All drawing objects, AttributeReference, Dimension

The newly created duplicate object.
Remarks

AttributeReference: You should not attempt to use this method on AttributeReference objects. AttributeReference objects inherit this method because they are one of the drawing objects, however, it is not feasible to perform this operation on an attribute reference.
Note: You cannot execute this method while simultaneously iterating through a collection. An iteration will open the work space for a read-only operation, while this method attempts to perform a read-write operation. Complete any iteration before you call this method.
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_Copy()
    ' This example creates a circle and then copies
    ' that circle. The new circle is then moved.
    
    ' Create the circle
    Dim circleObj As AcadCircle
    Dim center(0 To 2) As Double

** CopyFrom Method (ActiveX)

Copies the settings for a dimension style, layout, or plot configuration.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.CopyFrom SourceObject

object

    Type: DimStyle, Layout, PlotConfiguration

    The objects this method applies to.
SourceObject

    Access: Input-only

    Type: DimStyle, Dim3PointAngular, DimAligned, DimAngular, DimArcLength, DimDiametric, DimOrdinate, DimRadial, DimRadialLarge, DimRotated, Document, Layout, Leader, PlotConfiguration

    The source object to be copied.

    Layout and PlotConfiguration: The source object must be a PlotConfiguration object.

    DimStyle: The source object must be either a DimStyle, Document, Dim3PointAngular, DimAligned, DimAngular, DimArcLength, DimDiametric, DimOrdinate, DimRadial, DimRadialLarge, DimRotated, or Leader.

Return Value (RetVal)

No return value.
Remarks

DimStyle: This method allows users to copy dimension style data into an existing dimension style from three different types of sources.

    If SourceObject is a dimension (this includes all dimension objects), Tolerance, or Leader object, this method copies the style for that object plus any object overrides.
    If SourceObject is a DimStyle object, this method copies the style data from that dimension style.
    If SourceObject is a Document object, this method copies the active dimension style settings for the drawing plus any drawing overrides.

Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_CopyFrom()

** CopyObjects Method (ActiveX)

Duplicates multiple objects (deep cloning).

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

RetVal = object.CopyObjects(Objects [, Owner] [, IDPairs])

object

    Type: Database, Document

    The objects this method applies to.
Objects

    Access: Input-only

    Type: Variant (array of Objects)

    The array of primary objects to be copied. All the objects must have the same owner, and the owner must belong to the database or document that is calling this method.
Owner

    Access: Input-only; optional

    Type: Variant (a single object)

    The new owner for the copied objects. If no owner is specified, the objects will be created with the same owner as the objects in the Objects array.
IDPairs

    Access: Input-output; optional

    Type: Variant (array of IDPair objects)

    Information on what happened during the copy and translation process.

        Input: an empty variant.
        Output: an array of IDPair objects.

Return Value (RetVal)

Type: Variant (array of objects)

An array of newly created duplicate objects. Only primary objects are returned in this array. For more information on what occurred during the CopyObjects operation, or a list of objects owned by primary objects that were also copied, consult the IDPairs parameter.
Remarks

To copy objects to another open drawing, set the Owner parameter to the other drawing's model space.

During the CopyObjects operation, objects that are owned or referenced by the primary objects in the Objects parameter will also be copied.
Note: You cannot execute this method while simultaneously iterating through a collection. An iteration will open the work space for a read-only operation, while this method attempts to perform a read-write operation. Complete any iteration before you call this method.

* Methods XXX
* Property A
** Action Property (ActiveX)

Specifies the security-related operations to be performed on a drawing.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.Action

object

    Type: SecurityParams

    The object this property applies to.

Property Value

Read-only: No

Type: Long; AcadSecurityParamsType enum

Specify one or more of the following constants for drawing encryption, drawing properties encryption, a digital signature, or a time stamp.

    ACADSECURITYPARAMS_ENCRYPT_DATA: 0x00000001
    ACADSECURITYPARAMS_ENCRYPT_PROPS: 0x00000002
    ACADSECURITYPARAMS_SIGN_DATA: 0x00000010
    ACADSECURITYPARAMS_ADD_TIMESTAMP: 0x00000020

Note: Starting with AutoCAD-2016 based products, the ability to password protect a drawing file has been discontinued. The constant values ACADSECURITYPARAMS_ENCRYPT_DATA and ACADSECURITYPARAMS_ENCRYPT_DATA are obsolete. The SaveAs method produces an error if either of the two constants is used.
Remarks

Each constant represents a security-related operation. When you use the Action property, at some point in the set of operations you must set the Action property to the ACADSECURITYPARAMS_SIGN_DATA constant.

To specify multiple security-related operations, add the constants representing the operations. For example, to sign a drawing and use a time stamp, specify the following:

ACADSECURITYPARAMS_SIGN_DATA + ACADSECURITYPARAMS_ADD_TIMESTAMP

Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_Action()
    ' This example encrypts and saves a file.
    Dim sp As AcadSecurityParams
    Set sp = GetInterfaceObject("AutoCAD.SecurityParams." + Left(AcadApplication.Version, 2))

** ActiveDimStyle Property (ActiveX)

Specifies the active dimension style.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.ActiveDimStyle

object

    Type: Document

    The object this property applies to.

Property Value

Read-only: No

Type: DimStyle

A user-specified variable declared as an AcadDimStyle object type.
Remarks

This style will be applied to all newly created dimensions. To change the style on an existing dimension, use the StyleName property.

To control the settings of the current document overrides, use the dimensioning system variables. See "System Variables" in the AutoCAD documentation for a list of dimensioning system variables.

When you change a dimensioning system variable, you are actually setting a document override for the active dimension style. You are not changing the active dimension style itself. To change the settings of a given dimension style, use the CopyFrom method. This method copies a dimension style configuration, including overrides, from a document, dimension, or other dimension style.

Dimensions created via the AutoCAD user interface are created with the active dimension style plus all document overrides. Dimensions created via ActiveX are created with the active dimension style only. To have the dimensions created via ActiveX take on the document overrides, use the CopyFrom method to copy the dimension style from the document to the active dimension style. This process will copy all existing overrides into the active dimension style.
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_ActiveDimStyle()
    ' This example returns the current dimension style
    ' and then sets a new style.
    ' Finally, it returns the style to the previous setting.
    Dim newDimStyle As AcadDimStyle
    Dim currDimStyle As AcadDimStyle
    
    ' Return current dimension style of active document

    ThisDrawing.ActiveDimStyle = newDimStyle    ' set current dimension style to newDimStyle
    MsgBox "The new dimension style is " & newDimStyle.name, vbInformation, "ActiveDimStyle Example"
    
    ' Reset the dimension style to its previous setting

** ActiveUCS Property (ActiveX)

Specifies the active UCS for the drawing.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.ActiveUCS

object

    Type: Document

    The object this property applies to.

Property Value

Read-only: No

Type: UCS

The active UCS for the drawing.
Remarks

Changes made to the current active UCS will become visible only after that UCS is reset as the active UCS.

If you try to get the active UCS value when the current UCS is unsaved, an error will occur. It is recommended that you confirm that the value of the UCSNAME system variable is not empty before you get the active UCS value. Alternatively, you can add a new UCS object and set it to active before getting the active UCS value.
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_ActiveUCS()
    ' This example returns the current saved UCS (or saves a new one dynamically)
    ' and then sets a new UCS.
    ' Finally, it returns the UCS to the previous setting.

** ActiveViewport Property (ActiveX)

Specifies the active viewport for the drawing.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.ActiveViewport

object

    Type: Document

    The object this property applies to.

Property Value

Read-only: No

Type: Viewport

The active viewport for the drawing.
Remarks

Changes made to the current active viewport will become visible only after you reset the viewport as the active viewport. To reset the active viewport, simply call this property with the updated viewport object.

Use the StatusID property to determine if a viewport is currently active.

You can iterate through existing viewports to find a particular viewport. To do this, first identify the name of the viewport configuration on which the desired viewport resides using the Name property. Additionally, if the viewport configuration has been split, each individual viewport on the configuration can be identified through the LowerLeftCorner and UpperRightCorner properties.

The LowerLeftCorner and UpperRightCorner properties represent the graphic placement of the viewport on the display. These properties are defined as follows (using a four-way split as an example):


Viewport 1—LowerLeftCorner = (0, .5), UpperRightCorner = (.5, 1)

Viewport 2—LowerLeftCorner = (.5, .5), UpperRightCorner = (1, 1)

Viewport 3—LowerLeftCorner = (0, 0), UpperRightCorner = (.5, .5)

Viewport 4—LowerLeftCorner = (.5, 0), UpperRightCorner = (1, .5)

Associativity can only be set when a hatch is created. See the AddHatch method for more information on creating a hatch.
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_AssociativeHatch()
    ' This example creates a hatch in model space.

** AttachmentPoint Property (ActiveX)

Specifies the attachment point for an MText object.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.AttachmentPoint

object

    Type: MText

    The object this property applies to.

Property Value

Read-only: No

Type: acAttachmentPoint enum

    acAttachmentPointTopLeft
    acAttachmentPointTopCenter
    acAttachmentPointTopRight
    acAttachmentPointMiddleLeft
    acAttachmentPointMiddleCenter
    acAttachmentPointMiddleRight
    acAttachmentPointBottomLeft
    acAttachmentPointBottomCenter
    acAttachmentPointBottomRight

Remarks

The attachment point specifies where the insertion point aligns with the text boundary. The option you select determines both the text justification and text spill in relation to the text boundary. The options for text justification are Left, Right, and Center. The options for text spill are Top, Mid (middle), and Bottom.


Top Left

left-justified, spills down
	

Top Center

center-justified, spills down
	

Top Right

right-justified, spills down


Mid Left

left-justified, spills up and down
	

Mid Center

center-justified, spills up and down
	

Mid Right

right-justified, spills up and down


Bottom Left

left-justified, spills up
	

Bottom Center

center-justified, spills up
	

Bottom Right

right-justified, spills up

When the AttachmentPoint property is changed, the position of the existing bounding box does not change; the text is simply rejustified within the bounding box. However, the InsertionPoint property reflects the coordinates of the attachment point being used, so the value of the InsertionPoint property will change to reflect the change in justification.
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_AttachmentPoint()
    Dim MTextObj As AcadMText
    Dim width As Double
    Dim text As String
    Dim count As Integer
    Dim attachPoint As String
    Dim corner(0 To 2) As Double
        
    corner(0) = 3#: corner(1) = 3#: corner(2) = 0#
    width = 10
    text = "Hello, World."
    ' Creates a MText object in model space
    Set MTextObj = ThisDrawing.ModelSpace.AddMText(corner, width, text)

    For count = 1 To 9
        MTextObj.AttachmentPoint = count
    
        ' Gets the attachment point of an MText object
        attachPoint = Choose(MTextObj.AttachmentPoint, "TopLeft", "TopCenter", "TopRight", "MiddleLeft", "MiddleCenter", "MiddleRight", "BottomLeft", "BottomCenter", "BottomRight")
    
        ThisDrawing.Regen True
        MsgBox "The attachment point of the MText is now: " & attachPoint, vbInformation, "AttachmentPoint Example"
    Next
End Sub

** AutomaticPlotLog Property (ActiveX)

Specifies whether to automatically save a Plot or Publish log.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.AutomaticPlotLog

object

    Type: PreferencesOutput

    The object this property applies to.

Property Value

Read-only: No

Type: Boolean

Controls if a log file is automatically created when plotting or publishing.
Remarks

This property is equivalent to the AutoCAD Options dialog box setting "Automatically Save Plot and Publish Log."
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_AutomaticPlotLog()
    ' This example sets the AutoCAD Options dialog box
    ' setting Automatically Save Plot and Publish Log to True.

    Dim MyPreference As AcadPreferencesOutput
    Set MyPreference = AcadApplication.preferences.Output
    MyPreference.AutomaticPlotLog = True

** AutoSaveInterval Property (ActiveX)

Specifies an automatic save interval in minutes.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.AutoSaveInterval

object

    Type: PreferencesOpenSave

    The object this property applies to.

Property Value

Read-only: No

Type: Integer

0 >= AutoSaveInterval <= 600

An interval equal to 0 disables automatic save.

An interval greater than 0 automatically saves the drawing at the specified intervals.
Remarks

The initial setting for this property is 120.

The timer starts as soon as you make a change to a drawing. It is reset and restarted whenever the drawing is saved. The current drawing is saved to auto.sv$ unless you have specified a different name using the AutoSavePath property.
Note: This property is also controlled by the SAVETIME system variable. The ISAVEBAK system variable (set using the CreateBackup property) improves the speed of incremental saves, especially for larger drawings. The ISAVEPERCENT system variable (set using the IncrementalSavePercent property) determines the amount of wasted space tolerated in a drawing.
Examples

VBA:

Sub Example_AutoSaveInterval()
    ' This example returns the current setting of
    ' AutoSaveInterval. It then changes the value, and finally
    ' it resets the value back to the original setting.

** Closed Property (ActiveX)

Specifies whether the 3D polyline, lightweight polyline, lofted surface, polyline, or spline is open or closed.

Supported platforms: Windows only
Signature

VBA:

object.Closed

object

    Type: 3DPolyline, LoftedSurface, LWPolyline, Polyline, Spline

    The objects this property applies to.

Property Value

Read-only: No (except for Spline objects)

Type: Boolean

    True: The object is closed.
    False: The object is open (default).

Remarks

An open 3D polyline

A closed 3D polyline

A lofted surface is closed if the cross-section curves that determine its profile are closed. For instance, if an arc is used in the lofting profile, the resulting surface is open. If closed curves such as circles are used for lofting, the resulting surface is closed.
